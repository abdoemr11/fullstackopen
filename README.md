I just finished the cypress final part of part 5 "Testing React App".
Cypress which used in the course is v9 so there are many aspects changed, first of all the naming convention
then the the introducing of compoenent testing. 
I think in a future year FSO can use cypress instead of [testing-library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)

Cypress appear to be very useful when it throw an cirtical error in the login process that I didn't notice before
and react didn't complain about it.
